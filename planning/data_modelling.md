it does not showcase the new improvement we've made1:21 PMReconsidered architectural design to elevate documentation standardsThe user is right. We discussed an important improvement where:

Policy should NOT duplicate data that's in RiskNote
RiskNote should be the single source of truth for coverage details and premiums
Policy should just be a container with computed properties that read from the latest RiskNote

This was the key insight we arrived at - that the intermediate step of updating Policy.risk_details is unnecessary when RiskNotes are transactional and show the most current data.
Let me revise the document to reflect this improved design as the recommended approach, making it clear this is the better pattern.Show moreDoneInsurance Brokerage Management System - Data Model Specification
Document Overview
Version: 2.0
Last Updated: February 2026
Purpose: Complete specification of data models and relationships for an insurance brokerage management system
Technology Stack: Python, FastAPI, SQLModel, PostgreSQL
⚠️ IMPORTANT DESIGN NOTE:
This document reflects the improved transactional pattern where RiskNotes are the single source of truth for policy state. Policy entities serve only as containers with computed properties that read from the latest RiskNote. This eliminates data duplication and synchronization issues.

1. Business Domain Context
1.1 What This System Does
This is a management system for an insurance brokerage agency (not an insurance company). The brokerage:

Acts as intermediary between clients and insurance companies
Issues Risk Notes (internal documents showing coverage and premium)
Manages policies issued by various insurers
Handles billing and payment collection
Tracks claims on behalf of clients
Earns commission on premiums

1.2 Key Business Concepts
Product: An insurance offering from a specific insurer (e.g., "Old Mutual Motor Comprehensive")
Policy: A container that identifies an insurance contract by the insurer's policy number (e.g., "010/070/1/012473/2025"). Does NOT store coverage details or premiums directly.
Risk Note: An internal transactional record that:

Shows what is covered at a specific point in time
Records the premium charged
Is created for every change (new, renewal, endorsement)
Acts as the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for policy state
Is NEVER given to clients (internal only)
Latest RiskNote = current policy state
Older RiskNotes = historical states

Invoice: A billing document sent to the client based on one or more Risk Notes
Receipt: A record of payment received from the client
Claim: A request for compensation under a policy

2. Core Architecture Pattern: Transactional RiskNotes
2.1 The Key Design Principle
SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH: RiskNotes contain ALL coverage data and premiums.
Policy (Container)
    ↓ has many
RiskNote (Transaction/Snapshot)
    ├─ RN #1: Aug 2024 - New Business → Value: 4.7M, Premium: 152K
    ├─ RN #2: Dec 2024 - Endorsement  → Value: 5.0M, Premium: +5K
    └─ RN #3: Aug 2025 - Renewal      → Value: 5.0M, Premium: 158K
         ↑
    LATEST = CURRENT STATE
Critical Rules:

Policy table does NOT store:

risk_details (coverage details)
current_premium
current_term_start/end


Policy table ONLY stores:

Identifiers (policy_number, client_id, product_id)
Status (Active/Lapsed/Cancelled)
Inception date
Computed properties that read from latest RiskNote


RiskNote table stores EVERYTHING:

Complete coverage details in policy_snapshot
Premium breakdown
Coverage period
Product configuration at that time


Current state = Latest RiskNote

Query: ORDER BY effective_date DESC LIMIT 1
No duplication, no sync issues


RiskNotes are IMMUTABLE:

Never UPDATE a RiskNote
Always CREATE new ones

3.4 Policy Management (IMPROVED DESIGN)
Policy
Purpose: Container identifying the insurance contract - does NOT store coverage details
⚠️ CRITICAL DESIGN PRINCIPLE:
Policy is just a container. All coverage details, premiums, and terms live in RiskNotes. Current state is computed from the latest RiskNote.
Fields:
FieldTypeConstraintsDescriptionidUUIDPrimary KeyUnique identifierpolicy_numberStringUnique, Indexed, RequiredInsurer's policy numberclient_idUUIDForeign Key → Client, Indexed, RequiredInsured partyproduct_idUUIDForeign Key → Product, Indexed, OptionalInsurance productstatusEnum(PolicyStatus)RequiredPolicy statusinception_dateDateRequiredWhen policy first startedcreated_atDateTimeDefault: now()Creation timestamp
Enums:
pythonPolicyStatus:
  - ACTIVE: Currently in force
  - LAPSED: Premium unpaid, coverage suspended
  - CANCELLED: Terminated before expiry
  - EXPIRED: Reached end date, not renewed
NO DATA DUPLICATION:

❌ Does NOT have risk_details
❌ Does NOT have current_premium
❌ Does NOT have current_term_start/end
❌ Does NOT have premium_breakdown

Computed Properties (read from latest RiskNote):
python@property
def current_risk_note(self) -> RiskNote | None:
    """Get the most recent risk note (current state)"""
    # SELECT * FROM risknote 
    # WHERE policy_id = self.id 
    # ORDER BY effective_date DESC 
    # LIMIT 1
    return self.risk_notes[0] if self.risk_notes else None

@property
def current_risk_details(self) -> dict:
    """Get current coverage details from latest risk note"""
    rn = self.current_risk_note
    return rn.policy_snapshot.get("risk_details", {}) if rn else {}

@property
def current_premium(self) -> Decimal:
    """Get current total premium from latest risk note"""
    rn = self.current_risk_note
    return rn.total_premium if rn else Decimal("0")

@property
def current_term_start(self) -> date | None:
    """Get current coverage period start from latest risk note"""
    rn = self.current_risk_note
    return rn.coverage_start if rn else None

@property
def current_term_end(self) -> date | None:
    """Get current coverage period end from latest risk note"""
    rn = self.current_risk_note
    return rn.coverage_end if rn else None
Relationships:

Many Policies → One Client
Many Policies → One Product
One Policy → Many RiskNotes (ordered by effective_date DESC)
One Policy → Many Claims

Usage Example:
python# Get current state (reads from latest RiskNote)
policy = session.get(Policy, policy_id)
current_value = policy.current_risk_details["vehicle"]["value"]
current_premium = policy.current_premium

# No manual updates needed - just create new RiskNote!

RiskNote
Purpose: The SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for policy state at any point in time
⚠️ CRITICAL: This is where ALL data lives
Key Characteristics:

Created for EVERY change to a policy (new, renewal, endorsement)
Immutable once issued (never UPDATE, always CREATE new)
Latest RiskNote = current policy state
Older RiskNotes = historical states
Contains complete snapshot of coverage, product, and premium
Internal document (never given to clients)
Linked to invoicing

Relationships:

Many RiskNotes → One Policy
Many RiskNotes → One User (created_by)
One RiskNote → One previous RiskNote (optional, for audit trail)
One RiskNote → Many subsequent RiskNotes
One RiskNote → Many InvoiceLineItems
One RiskNote → Many ReceiptAllocations

Business Rules:

Immutability: Once status != "Draft", NEVER update. Create new instead.
Ordering: Always query with ORDER BY effective_date DESC to get latest first.
Current State: Latest RiskNote (by effective_date) = current policy state.
Historical State: Query RiskNotes WHERE effective_date <= target_date.
Chaining: Set previous_risk_note_id to maintain audit trail.

Required Index:
sqlCREATE INDEX ix_risknote_policy_effective 
  ON risknote(policy_id, effective_date DESC)
  WHERE status NOT IN ('CANCELLED', 'REPLACED');

4. Key Design Improvements Summary
4.1 Before (Data Duplication Problem)
python# Old pattern - data in TWO places
class Policy(SQLModel, table=True):
    risk_details: dict  # ← Coverage details HERE
    current_premium: Decimal  # ← Premium HERE
    current_term_start: date  # ← Term HERE
    
class RiskNote(SQLModel, table=True):
    policy_snapshot: dict  # ← ALSO HERE (duplication!)
    total_premium: Decimal  # ← ALSO HERE (duplication!)

# Problem: On endorsement, must update BOTH
policy.risk_details = new_details  # Update 1
policy.current_premium = new_premium  # Update 2
risk_note.policy_snapshot = {...}  # Update 3

# What if they get out of sync?
4.2 After (Single Source of Truth)
python# New pattern - data in ONE place
class Policy(SQLModel, table=True):
    # Just metadata
    policy_number: str
    client_id: UUID
    status: PolicyStatus
    inception_date: date
    
    # Computed properties (read from latest RiskNote)
    @property
    def current_risk_details(self) -> dict:
        return self.current_risk_note.policy_snapshot["risk_details"]
    
    @property
    def current_premium(self) -> Decimal:
        return self.current_risk_note.total_premium

class RiskNote(SQLModel, table=True):
    # ALL DATA HERE (single source of truth)
    policy_snapshot: dict  # Contains risk_details
    total_premium: Decimal
    coverage_start: date
    coverage_end: date
    effective_date: date  # For ordering

# On endorsement, just CREATE new RiskNote
new_risk_note = RiskNote(
    policy_id=policy.id,
    policy_snapshot={"risk_details": new_details},
    total_premium=new_premium,
    # ...
)
# That's it! No policy updates needed
# policy.current_risk_details automatically returns new_details
```

### 4.3 Benefits

1. **No Duplication**: Data exists in exactly one place
2. **No Sync Issues**: Can't get out of sync
3. **Automatic History**: All RiskNotes form complete audit trail
4. **Simpler Mutations**: Just create new RiskNote, don't update Policy
5. **Matches Business Model**: RiskNotes ARE the business documents
6. **Event Sourcing Pattern**: Each RiskNote is an event, latest = current state

6. Database Indexes
Required Indexes for Performance:
sql-- Unique constraints
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ix_user_email ON user(email);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ix_client_kra_pin ON client(kra_pin);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ix_insurer_name ON insurer(name);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ix_policy_policy_number ON policy(policy_number);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ix_risknote_risk_note_number ON risknote(risk_note_number);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ix_invoice_invoice_number ON invoice(invoice_number);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ix_receipt_receipt_number ON receipt(receipt_number);

-- Foreign key indexes
CREATE INDEX ix_policy_client_id ON policy(client_id);
CREATE INDEX ix_policy_product_id ON policy(product_id);
CREATE INDEX ix_risknote_policy_id ON risknote(policy_id);
CREATE INDEX ix_claim_policy_id ON claim(policy_id);
CREATE INDEX ix_invoice_client_id ON invoice(client_id);
CREATE INDEX ix_receipt_client_id ON receipt(client_id);

-- Search/filter indexes
CREATE INDEX ix_client_name ON client(name);
CREATE INDEX ix_risknote_effective_date ON risknote(effective_date);
CREATE INDEX ix_risknote_created_at ON risknote(created_at);

-- CRITICAL: Composite index for "get latest risk note" query
CREATE INDEX ix_risknote_policy_effective 
  ON risknote(policy_id, effective_date DESC)
  WHERE status IN ('ISSUED', 'REPLACED');
  
-- This makes policy.current_risk_note very fast

Querying Current State:
python# Get policy
policy = session.get(Policy, "uuid-policy-1")

# Current state comes from latest RiskNote automatically
current_value = policy.current_risk_details["vehicle"]["value"]
# Returns: "5000000" (from RiskNote #2)

current_premium = policy.current_premium
# Returns: Decimal("5798.63") (from RiskNote #2)

# Historical state
risk_note_1 = session.get(RiskNote, "uuid-risknote-1")
original_value = risk_note_1.policy_snapshot["risk_details"]["vehicle"]["value"]
# Returns: "4700000"

8. Critical Business Rules
8.1 RiskNote Rules (IMPROVED)

Single Source of Truth: ALL coverage data and premiums ONLY in RiskNote.policy_snapshot
Immutability: Once status = "ISSUED", NEVER update. Create new RiskNote instead.
Ordering: Latest RiskNote (by effective_date DESC) = current policy state
Chaining: Set previous_risk_note_id to maintain audit trail
Financial Accuracy:

total_premium = net_premium + sum(all values in levies)
commission_amount = net_premium × (commission_rate / 100)


Transaction Types:

NEW_BUSINESS: First risk note, previous_risk_note_id = NULL
RENEWAL: New coverage period, new effective_date
ENDORSEMENT: Same coverage period, updated risk_details
CANCELLATION: May have negative premium (refund)



8.2 No Policy Updates on Transactions
Critical Rule: When creating RiskNotes (endorsements, renewals), do NOT update Policy fields. Just create the new RiskNote. The Policy.current_* properties will automatically reflect the new state.
python# ❌ OLD WAY (don't do this)
policy.risk_details = new_details
policy.current_premium = new_premium
risk_note = RiskNote(policy_snapshot=new_details, ...)

# ✅ NEW WAY (correct)
risk_note = RiskNote(
    policy_id=policy.id,
    policy_snapshot={"risk_details": new_details},
    total_premium=new_premium,
    # ...
)
# Done! policy.current_risk_details now returns new_details automatically
```

### 8.3 Invoice & Payment Rules

(Same as before - no changes needed for financials)

### 8.4 Commission Calculation

Kenya insurance levies (as of 2025):
- Training Levy: 0.2% of net premium
- PHCF (Policyholders Compensation Fund): 0.25% of net premium
- Stamp Duty: KES 40 (fixed)

Example calculation:
```
Net Premium: 152,750.00
Training Levy (0.2%): 305.50
PHCF (0.25%): 381.88
Stamp Duty: 40.00
─────────────────────────
Total Premium: 153,477.38

Commission (10%): 15,275.00 (on net premium only)
8.5 Data Type Requirements
CRITICAL: All monetary values MUST use Decimal(15,2), NOT float
Example:
pythonnet_premium: Decimal = Field(sa_type=Numeric(15, 2))
Reason: Float arithmetic causes rounding errors in financial calculations.

10. API Structure Reference
(Same as before - no changes to API endpoints)

11. Environment Configuration
(Same as before - no changes to environment variables)

12. Known Design Decisions
12.1 Why This Pattern is Better
Problem Solved: Data duplication between Policy and RiskNote
Solution: RiskNote is single source of truth, Policy has computed properties
Benefits:

No sync issues (can't get out of sync)
Simpler code (just create RiskNote, don't update Policy)
Automatic history (all RiskNotes form audit trail)
Matches business model (RiskNotes are the real documents)
Event sourcing pattern (each RiskNote = event)

Tradeoff: Slightly more complex queries (need to join/eager load risk_notes)
Mitigation: Proper indexing makes queries fast
12.2 When to Use This Pattern
✅ Use when:

Data changes over time and history matters
Need complete audit trail
Want to avoid sync issues
Transactions are the business documents

❌ Don't use when:

Current state rarely changes
History not important
Need maximum query performance on current state

For this insurance brokerage system: ✅ Perfect fit
